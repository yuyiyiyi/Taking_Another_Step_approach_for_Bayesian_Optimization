# Overview

This is the MATLAB implementation of the ***Taking Another Step approach for Bayesian optimization (TAS-BO)*** proposed in [1].  

This is an approach that utilizes the notion of coarse-to-fine search,  and improves the local search ability for the standard Bayesian optimization on high-dimensional problems. 

The implementation is based on the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm. The original code for the Efficient Global Optimization algorithm is available at https://github.com/zhandawei/Efficient_Global_Optimization_Algorithms.
